## Project Settings

Configure your project by creating or updating a settings.json file at the project's root. If you already have a `.vscode/settings.json` file, skip the first two steps.

1. Open the command palette in VSCode:

   - `CTRL + SHIFT + P` (Windows)
   - `CMD + SHIFT + P` (Mac OS)

2. Type `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)`.

3. In the `.vscode/settings.json` file, copy and paste the following settings:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "jsonFlow.enable": true, // Enable or disable the extension. Example: true, false
     "jsonFlow.files.include": [
         "json",
         "jsonc"
     ], // The file extensions to watch for changes. Example: "json", "jsonc"
     "jsonFlow.files.exclude": [
         "**/node_modules/**",
         "**/dist/**",
         "**/out/**",
         "**/build/**",
         "**/vendor/**"
     ], // The files to exclude from watching. Example: "**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/out/**", "**/build/**", "**/vendor/**"
     "jsonFlow.files.showPath": true, // Show the path of the file in the file name. Example: "home.component.tsx (pages/home)"
     "jsonFlow.graph.showValues": true, // Show the values of the nodes in the graph. Example: "name: 'John Doe'"
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeWidth": 200, // The width of the nodes in the graph. Example: 200
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeHeight": 50, // The height of the nodes in the graph. Example: 50
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeBorderColor": "white", // The border color of the nodes in the graph. Example: "white"
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeColor": "white", // The color of the nodes in the graph. Example: "white"
     "jsonFlow.graph.edgeColor": "white", // The color of the edges in the graph. Example: "white"
     "jsonFlow.graph.layoutDirection": "TB", // The layout direction of the graph. Example: "TB", "LR"
     "jsonFlow.image.folder": "images", // The folder where the images will be saved. Example: "images"
   }
   ```

4. **Restart VS Code**

Your project is now set up to automatically format code upon saving.
