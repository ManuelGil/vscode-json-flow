## Vision and Long-Term Objectives

JSON Flow aims to be the preferred solution for developers and analysts working with JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, and other data formats. By combining intuitive visualizations with practical features, the extension simplifies data exploration and enhances productivity.

---

## Planned Features and Improvements

### 1. **Performance Optimization for Large Files**

- **Objective**: Address challenges when visualizing very large or deeply nested data files.
- **Details**:
  - Optimize internal processes to handle larger datasets more efficiently.
  - Improve how memory is used to reduce delays during tree generation.
- **Why it Matters**: Users working with extensive data structures will experience smoother interactions and faster visualizations.
- **Current Status**: Research and development phase.

---

### 2. **Customizable Data Visualization**

- **Objective**: Provide users with greater control over how data is displayed.
- **Details**:
  - Introduce options to switch between compact and detailed views of data.
  - Add filters to focus on specific keys or values.
  - Enable conditional styling for nodes based on user-defined criteria.
- **Why it Matters**: Customization ensures the visualizations align with individual workflows, making data analysis more efficient.
- **Current Status**: Under design.

---

### 3. **Enhanced Navigation and Interactivity**

- **Objective**: Make the exploration of complex data structures more intuitive.
- **Details**:
  - Allow users to collapse or expand all nodes with a single action.
  - Add contextual tooltips to display additional information for nodes.
  - Enable users to add comments or notes directly to specific parts of the data tree.
- **Why it Matters**: These enhancements will simplify navigation and provide deeper insights into the data.
- **Current Status**: Planned.

---

### 4. **Accessibility and Localization**

- **Objective**: Ensure JSON Flow is accessible to a diverse audience.
- **Details**:
  - Introduce keyboard navigation for users who prefer or require non-mouse interaction.
  - Add support for screen readers to make visualizations more inclusive.
  - Localize the extension into multiple languages for broader usability.
- **Why it Matters**: Accessibility and localization make the tool usable for everyone, regardless of technical skill or location.
- **Current Status**: Pending implementation.

---

### 5. **Community Engagement and Feedback**

- **Objective**: Foster collaboration and gather user feedback to shape the extension’s evolution.
- **Details**:
  - Use GitHub Issue Tracker for feature suggestions and bug reporting.
  - Regularly prioritize and implement features based on user votes and feedback.
  - Provide clear contribution guidelines for developers who want to enhance the extension.
- **Why it Matters**: Engaging with the community ensures the extension evolves to meet real-world needs.
- **Current Status**: Ongoing.

## Known Challenges

While JSON Flow continues to evolve, there are some challenges that we are actively working to address:

- **Performance with Large Files**: Visualizing very large or deeply nested datasets can sometimes be slow. Although the recursive approach used for tree generation is essential for certain features, we are exploring optimizations to improve speed and memory usage.

If you encounter issues or have ideas for improvement, please don’t hesitate to reach out via our GitHub repository.
